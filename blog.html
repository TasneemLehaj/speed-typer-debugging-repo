                                    session storage?</h5>
                                <p class="card-text"> <b>Local Storage: </b>This read-only interface property provides
                                    access to the Document’s local storage object, the stored data is stored across
                                    browser sessions.<br>
                                    <b>Session Storage :</b>Session Storage objects can be accessed using the
                                    sessionStorage read-only property.

                                <p> The difference between sessionStorage and
                                    localStorage is that localStorage data does not expire, whereas sessionStorage data
                                    is cleared when the page session ends.Similar to sessionStorage, except that
                                    localStorage data gets cleared when the page session ends – that is when the page is
                                    closed. It is cleared when the last “private” tab of a browser is closed
                                    (localStorage data for a document loaded in a private browsing or incognito
                                    session).<br>The storage capacity of local storage is 5MB/10MB. On the other hand,
                                    the storage capacity of session storage is 5MB.<br>
                                    There are four methods for both of this storages. They are - setItem() Method ,
                                    getItem() Method, removeItem() Method and removeItem() MEthod.<br>
                                    However, as local storage is not- session-based, it must be deleted via javascript
                                    or manually. whereas session storage is session-based and works per window or tab.
                                    This means that data is stored only for the duration of a session, i.e., until the
                                    browser (or tab) is closed.<br>One thing is to mention is that, in both the cases,
                                    client can only read local storage and there is no transfer of data to the server.

                                </h5>
                                <p class="card-text"> JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop, which is
                                    responsible for executing the code, collecting and processing events, and executing
                                    queued sub-tasks. This model is quite different from models in other languages. <br>
                                    The event loop is the secret behind JavaScript’s asynchronous programming. JS
                                    executes all operations on a single thread, but using a few smart data structures,
                                    it gives us the illusion of multi-threading.That is why JavaScript is synchronous
                                    and asynchronous at the same time.<br> There are three things in an event loop such
                                    as - heap/ memory, call stack and event queue.<br>The call stack is responsible for
                                    keeping track of all the operations in line to be executed. Whenever a function is
                                    finished, it is popped from the stack.<br>
                                    The event queue is responsible for sending new functions to the stack for
                                    processing. It follows the queue data structure to maintain the correct sequence in
                                    which all operations should be sent for execution.<br> Whenever an async function is
                                    called, it is sent to a browser API. These are APIs built into the browser. Based on
                                    the command received from the call stack, the API starts its own single-threaded
                                    operation. Now when there is an operation which takes time such as fetch or
                                    setTimeOut method in the stack,it is sent to the corresponding API which waits till
                                    the specified time to send this operation back in for processing. It sends the
                                    operation to the Event queue. Hence, it creates a cyclic system for running async
                                    operations in JavaScript. The language itself is single-threaded, but the browser
                                    APIs act as separate threads.

                                    The event loop facilitates this process; it constantly checks whether or not the
                                    call stack is empty. If it is empty, new functions are added from the event queue.
                                    If it is not, then the current function call is processed.
                                </p>

                                    are -<br>
                                    1.Variable which is not inistialized will give undefined.<br>

                                    3.Parameter that is not passed will be undefined. <br>
                                    4.If return has nothing on the right side will give return undefined. <br>
                                    5.Property that does not exist on an object will give undefined.<br>
                                    6.Accessing array elements outside of the index range will give undefined. <br>
                                    7.Deleting an element inside an array will give undefined. Instead of it, splice
                                    should be used.<br>
